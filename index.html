                Building a relationship with a new language has many steps
                before you can even start speaking it. First you start
                recognizing the shape of written words, followed by recognizing
                mumbles and intonations, maybe then detecting native accents in
                other languages, before repeating proper sounds, remembering
                your metro station name, and the most common greetings.
              </p>
              <p class="p-intro-text">
                I moved to Finland almost a year ago. It was my first time being
                so far from Bogota, my hometown in Colombia. Although most
                people in Helsinki speak English, it doesn’t mean that life
                takes place in English. This creates a permanent “lost in
                translation” feeling, that is hard to describe and difficult to
                share with someone who has never heard a word in Finnish.
              </p>
              <p class="p-intro-text">
                When you look up for characteristics of the Finnish language you
                usually get more or less the same things: it is not a
                Indo-European language, but Uralic (this means that unless you
                speak Estonian or Hungarian no other language you know
                resembles). It is genderless (for real, no word for “she” or
                “he”, just “they”). There’s no exact word for “please” (its
                direct, you can use “kiitos” which is the same as thank you).
                And it has really long words, because it has a lot of composed
                words and endings that add up. Because of that it has one of the
                longest known word(61 letters):
                “lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas”,
                which translates as: 'airplane jet turbine engine auxiliary
                mechanic non-commissioned officer student’.
              </p>
              <p class="p-intro-text">
                I tried to create a visual approach of these new sounds I’ve
                been listening. And to share that experience of getting familiar
                with a new language from a non-native speaker perspective (and
                by no means it is a scientific, exclusive and all encompassing
                judgement).

        <p><b>Project by:</b> Adelaida Avila Cabrera</p>
        <p>This project was created as part of the Studio Information Design course in Aalto University.</p>
        <p>Buttons and waveforms were made with P5.js. You can access the sketches <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/aavilac/collections/qct_y5KWE" target="_blank">here</a></here>. Pictures were taken by me in Helsinki. The voice for the Alphabet sound was taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob4nKPqBG-8" target="_blank">"Aakkoset"</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HqCHmhvyJPAyUc-VVUJwQ/about" target="_blank">Lukutaidon opetus ja suomen alkeet.</a></p>
        <p>The <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/" target="_blank">speech recognition library</a> is by R. Luke DuBois from ABILITY Project / Integrated Design & Media in NYU</p>
        <p>Special thanks to Katri, Milja, Juha and Iisa for their voices.</p>
